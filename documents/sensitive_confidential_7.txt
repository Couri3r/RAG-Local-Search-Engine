John has been with our company for [X] years and has consistently demonstrated strong skills in marketing strategy and team leadership. However, there have been some areas of concern that need to be addressed to meet the expectations of his role.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* Achieve a project delivery timeframe of 8 weeks or less for all marketing campaigns
* Present a detailed budget plan for all future marketing initiatives for approval from management prior to expenditure
* Attend a minimum of 2 leadership and team management workshops to improve his skills in delegating tasks effectively

**Salary Adjustment:**

Due to John's performance under the current salary structure, we are considering a salary adjustment. Based on industry standards and internal equity considerations, we believe that John's salary should be adjusted upwards by [X]% to reflect his contributions to the company.

**Next Steps:**

* Quarterly check-ins will be scheduled to review John's progress against the PIP objectives
* A follow-up meeting will be scheduled in 6 months to assess John's performance and determine if any further adjustments are needed
